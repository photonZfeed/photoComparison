## About

This repository hosts the spreadsheet files for reporting a pragmatic minimum set of data to be reported in light-driven
catalysis suggested in "Challenges and Concepts for comparative evaluation of light-driven catalysis" by Dirk
Ziegenbalg, Andrea Pannwitz, Sven Rau, Benjamin Dietzek-Ivanšić and Carsten Streb. A preprint can be found on
Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5575038.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5575038)

This repository also acts as the central place for contributing to the development of the minimum dataset to be reported
in light-driven catalysis. See the section [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute) for details.

## Getting Started

Simply use the empty spreadsheet [file](./photoComparison-worksheet_empty.xlsx) and fill in your experimental data.
An example can be found [here](./photoComparison-worksheet_example.xlsx)

## How to Contribute

Contributions on improving this minimal data set are highly welcome. Please check the existing
issues [here](https://github.com/photonZfeed/photoComparison/issues) if there is already a similar existing issue
addressing the same points. If not, please create a new
issue [here](https://github.com/photonZfeed/photoComparison/issues/new/choose). The photoComparability team will
handle all issues raised here.
